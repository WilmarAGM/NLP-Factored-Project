# REAL OR NOT? NLP WITH DISASTER TWEETS
In this project we build Machine learning models to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones aren't. It is a Kaggle challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started) about NLP, and it was the project we developed in the Factored AI Sessions. (Jan - Apr, 2020)
## Technologies: Python, Colab Notebooks, Machine Learning, TensorFlow Hub.
## Metrics: F1 Score
F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
## Models
* LogisticRegression
* RandomForestClassifier
* LightGBM
* SVC
## Embedding methods
* Bags of words [sklearn]
* TF-IDF [sklearn]
* Universal Sentence Encoder (TensorFlow Hub) [https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4]

## Hyperparameter Tuning
* Randomized Search
